<h4 id="map">Map</h4>

<p>The main view of the app is a map that you can move and zoom in or out. Tap on a campground marker to view it’s detail card. Campground markers are color coded by type: National Park, National Forest, State Park, etc. To see a full list of campground types and their color codes, see the Campground Details section.
The number of campgrounds displayed at one time is limited for performance, so if you zoom out too far only campgrounds closest to the center of the map will be displayed.
While campground data is available offline, map data is not. If you have viewed an area with the map before your data connection is unavailable, map imagery may be cached for a period of time.</p>

<h4 id="location-button">Location Button</h4>

<p>Tap the Location button to center the map on your current location.</p>

<h4 id="map-list">Map List</h4>

<p>Tap the List button to display campgrounds sorted by distance from the center of the map. After a search selection, the list will show campgrounds that are nearest to that search result regardless of map position. When the search selection is cleared, the list will revert back to displaying campgrounds sorted by distance from the center of the map.</p>

<h4 id="campground-details">Campground Details</h4>

<p>When a map marker is selected, the campground details card will pop-up from the bottom of the screen. Tap that card to expose information about the campground. You can share that campground with your friends, mark it as a favorite, or add it to a list. You can also get directions to the campground by tapping Get Directions, which will open your map app to lookup driving directions.</p>

<p>You can also find campground websites, phone numbers, photos, reviews, and weather by tapping on those options in the detail card.</p>

<p>Tap the Get Coordinates row to copy campground latitude and longitude to your clipboard.
Campgrounds are assigned a color code for the type of organization that manages the facility. The following are the color codes used by Kampnik:</p>

<h4 id="search">Search</h4>

<p>Search by campground name or town name. When either is selected, the map will center on that search result to show campgrounds nearest to that location.</p>

<p>When searching, you can enter the campground or town name, state name, organization name (such as Mount Rainier National Park), but entering the town and state names together may not yield the best results. Campgrounds and Towns are differentiated by an icon that is displayed on the left of each row.</p>

<h4 id="recents">Recents</h4>

<p>When a search result is selected, it is marked to be displayed in the Recent list so that you can easily get back to it without re-typing the search. To clear recent selections, tap &lsquo;Clear search history&rsquo; in app settings.</p>

<h4 id="favorites">Favorites</h4>

<p>Favorite a campground to quickly access it later on. Pretty simple, that is it.</p>

<h4 id="lists">Lists</h4>

<p>Lists are similar to favorites, but they can be organized into - a list. Organize your summer road trip, build a bucket list, or keep a list per state of the best campgrounds you have visited.</p>

<h4 id="send-feedback">Send Feedback</h4>

<p>If you find something you like, or don’t, or you want to request a new feature, tell us about it. The Send Feedback menu option gives you direct access to tell us what’s on your mind, so please use it.</p>

<h4 id="campground-data">Campground Data</h4>

<p>While we try to keep our data as up-to-date as possible, things change, and as such some campground details may be out of date or inaccurate. Campground coordinates are usually close enough to get you in the general area, but you may need to look left or right to find the campground. If you encounter a campground for which our data isn&rsquo;t up-to-date, let us know so that we may update the database.</p>

<p>Distances are airplane distance calculations and not turn-by-turn.</p>

<p>Amenities not listed does not imply that amenity is not available.</p>

<p>Season schedules change frequently, check with campground to be sure.</p>

<p>Some RV lengths are included in amenities, but check with campground to ensure accuracy.</p>
